# Supervised-Learning-with-Scikit_Learn

The goal of supervised learning is to predict a doctor’s diagnosis or to make predictions about the future say whether a customer will click on an add or not. For supervised learning, we need labeled data and there are many ways to get it, we can get historical data which already has labels that we are interested in; we can perform experiments to get labeled data, such as A/B testing to see how many clicks we get, or we can also get crowdsourced labeling data which, like reCAPTCHA does for text recognition. In any case, the goal is to learn from data for which the right output is known, so that we can make predictions on new data for which we don’t know the output.

There are many ways to perform supervised learning in Python. I have used fundamentals of supervised learning using various real life datasets and used various techniques like exploratory data analysis, visualize EDA, imputing numberical and categorical missing values using complex techniques like KNN. I also used regularization techniques such and Lasso and Ridge regression that also helps to identify features with most profound impact on the dependent variable. Making this document has provided me with more than adequate experience, knowledge and tools to pre process and clean data and to run classification and regression problems on any data in any industry.
